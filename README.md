# PHSEngineeringProjects
This is a folder for all the coding in different languages that I have done in different engineering classes. Each project is different and serves a different purpose.

Currently I have only worked on two projects. 

***1. Survivor Island***
  * This was a team-based project where we were tasked to map out, code in C++, and adjust the trajectory and pathfinding of a rover that could traverse a variety of obstacles, adapting with the terrain and sensing it using different commands.

***2. FalconWing***
  * This was a team-based project where we were tasked to engineer, sense, and develop a prosthetic that would mimic the action of a hand opening/closing using MyoWare, an EMG-sensing device that was coded and powered by an Arduino and C++.
